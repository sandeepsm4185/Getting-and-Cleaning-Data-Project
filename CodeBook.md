# This document is a codebook for the tidy data set summary.txt:
**Subject** - this column identifies the subjects (1 through 30) who participated in the project 
**Activity** - this column identifies the activity performed by the subject: laying, sitting, standing, walking, walking downstairs, walking upstairs

The remaining columns are the mean of mean or standard deviations of sensory output derived from the subjects during each of the above activities, details below:

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

# Source of data:
Sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) from 30 volunteers for a set of activities. For details, see below:

# Steps performed as part of the Project:
1. Source data had broken down the data from 30 subjects to two sets - train and test. These were joined back to form a tidy data set.
2. Activities and sensor signals were represented in codes, these were changed to descriptive labels (for details, see codebook)
3. Sensor output columns other than those representing mean or standard deviation were removed.
4. Summary table (summary.txt) was created with mean of each of the above variables (mean and standard deviation) for each subject and activity.
